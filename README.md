# EVO
Plug in & Play Pytorch Implementation of the paper: "Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes" by Sakana AI! This repository will host all merge methods presented in the paper such as DARE, TaskArithmetic, TIESMerging, and the evolutionary algorithm they use. Also, I attempt to implement their future work to create swarms of models using merge methods for various real-world verticals!

## Todo
- [ ] Implement the evolutionary algorithm
- [ ] Make it plug in and play
